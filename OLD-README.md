## About 
###*New - Now Supports Music Playback (20200519)
Utilize the kodi API and Python library for controlling the KODI open source media center with Mycroft.ai. The control is mostly geared towards videos/movies but is capable of handling cursor navigation as well.

using conversational context.
* eg. "hey mycroft:"
* Request: "ask kodi to play the move Iron Man"
* Response: "I have located 3 movies with the name Iron Man, would you like me to list them?"
* Request: "yes" / "no"
* Response: "Iron Man, to Skip, say Next, say play, to play, or Cancel, to stop"
* Request: "next" / "skip"
* Response: "Iron Man 2"
* Request: "play" / "select"
* Response: "o-k, attempting to play, Iron Man 2"
## Cinemavision Addon
If mycroft.ai locates the addon CinemaVision it will prompt the user if this addon should be used during the 
playback of the movie that was selected.
* Response: "Would you like to play the movie using cinemavision?"
* Request: "yes / no"
## Youtube Addon
